# Bernard Polidario's Software Engineering Portfolio

Welcome to my web portfolio! This template is designed to assist you in initiating development using Vue 3 within the Vite framework.

## Recommended IDE Setup

For an optimal development experience, I recommend using [Visual Studio Code (VSCode)](https://code.visualstudio.com/) along with the [Volar](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.volar) extension (please disable Vetur) and the [TypeScript Vue Plugin (Volar)](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.vscode-typescript-vue-plugin).

## Customize Configuration

To tailor the configuration according to your needs, refer to the [Vite Configuration Reference](https://vitejs.dev/config/).

## Project Setup

To get started, install the necessary dependencies with the following command:

```sh
npm install
```

### Compile and Hot-Reload for Development

For production deployment, use the following command to compile and minify the project:

```sh
npm run dev
```

### Compile and Minify for Production

For production deployment, use the following command to compile and minify the project:

```sh
npm run build
```

### Run Unit Tests with [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/)

Execute the following command to run unit tests using Vitest:

```sh
npm run test:unit
```

### Lint with [ESLint](https://eslint.org/)
